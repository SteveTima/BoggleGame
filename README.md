# BoggleGame
This is a C++ implementation of the game "Boggle".


For this game two versions have been implemented: 
    - a console version located in the directory "BoggleConsoleApp"
    - a graphic version located in the directory "BoggleGuiApp"

For the graphic version the framework "Qt" is used for creating graphical user interfaces.

There is also a function library used by both versions (Console & Graphic)

The framework "GoogleTest" is used for testing some functions from the library (see directory "Tests")
